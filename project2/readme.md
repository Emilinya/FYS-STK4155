# Project 2

This project uses a makefile to run the programs. The makefile is auto-generated by the program `smakefile.py`.
* Running `make linfit` will run the code that tries different gradient descent methods.
* Running `make ffnn_regression` will run the code that uses the neural network to do regression.
* Running `make ffnn_classification` will run the code that classifies breast cancer
* Running `make ffnn_logreg` will run the code that classifies hand drawn digits.

All the python plotting creates svgs, so the script `svg2pdf.sh` is used to convert the svgs to pdfs that can be used in a latex rapport.
