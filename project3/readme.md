The code for this project is in the `src` folder. The programs ending in `_solver` create data in the `data`
folder, while the programs ending in `_plotter` create images in the `imgs` folder. The file `utils.py`
has a simple timer class to time things.

The script `svg2pdf.sh` is used to convert the svgs created by the plotting programs to pdfs that can
be used in a latex document.
